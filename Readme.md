# How to sort a ListView in code
Scenario:
You need to sort a list view by a class property and disallow end-users from changing this sorting themselves.

Solution:
Implement a ViewController and configure sorting for the required column of this ListView in the application model. This is done in the SortListViewControllerBase class, which is platform-agnostic.<br />
After that, we should implement platform-dependant controllers that will disable the sorting functionality in the grid. 

This approach can be used to sort both nested and root ListViews, and also will work if the server mode is enabled in the ListView.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong><br />
